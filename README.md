I am a driven and ambitious full stack web developer, looking to break into the exciting world of software development. After six years of working at a top [management consultancy](http://www.thehackettgroup.com/), I wanted a change. Despite access and insight into some of the worlds leading global companies, I wanted a more creative career. After leaving my job, I spent some time completing my private pilots license and then learnt to code at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a highly selective 16 week intensive bootcamp. I love the infinite creative possibilities that programming allows.

At Makers Academy, I was very privileged to have the opportunity to learn in an environment which focused on best practices, object-orientated programming and test driven development. These principles are instilled in you from the very start. I have proven to pick up languages very quickly and I can add great value to a company utilizing all the knowledge and skills that I have gained from my previous roles. I would like to work in an oganisation which also adheres to coding best practices and continue to develop as a programmer, in an environment with creative, intelligent and helpful colleagues.

## Skills<a name="skills"></a>

#### Attention to detail

During my previous roles, the finer details were paramount, whether it was reviewing a client proposal, preparing a client/internal presentation or ensuring to cover every variable when working with marketing  to organise an event. For instance, I executed a faultless Annual Leadership Forum for a hundred and fifty delegates, with praise from clients, my Principle and Managing Director. Additionally, it's a skill which I developed to a much higher level through my training as a private pilot. From a thorough pre-flight planning session, to countless pre-flight and in-flight checks, nothing is left to chance.

#### Communication

Communication was key in my role at The Hackett Group, with exposure to clients, at all levels, on a daily basis. From countless onsite and virtual (WebEx) meetings/presentations and events, I learnt to adapt my approach depending on whether it was a one-to-one meeting with a CPO or a presentation to an audience of over one hundred.

#### Problem solving

Thinking outside the box and solving problems is something I am very good at. During my time at The English National Opera (ENO), I would often have to accommodate bespoke client requests, e.g. holding a dinner on the stage for patrons of the ENO. Regardless of how challenging the logistics, being highly motivated I relished the opportunity and made sure that I always delivered.
